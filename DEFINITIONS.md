# Definitions
There are several different kinds of definitions in this hypothetical language. A definition is any statement that declares the statement of some construct.
Constructs include but not limited to:
1. Properties
2. Functions
3. Classes
4. Data structures
5. Constants
6. Enums

```
//Top level program property declarations
def five = 5
def string = "Hello world"
def a = A()

//Top level class delcaration
//Basic class definition with omitted empty constructor parameters
def class A{
	
}
```
