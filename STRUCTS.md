# Structs
Structs in Beagle will be represented in memory in a completely different way. You can think of structs as being invariant to classes. Where classes will be compiled with VTables to represent their abstractions in a zero-cost way, structs will be represented in memory as packed structs without a VTable, regardless of whether it has abstracted composition. Structs allow you to work with objects in a zero-cost data-oriented way, as opposed to classes and VTables, which are a zero-cost object-oriented way. This allows the programmer to have consistency within dedicated mindsets. When working with concepts that must be done in an object oriented way, such as GUI systems, it can be done at zero-cost using classes and interfaces. However, when working with objects that must be done in a data oriented way, such as Entity systems in game engines, where the entity hierarchy can contains arbitrary entities with arbitrary constraints with arbitrary lifetimes that are only predicted by their constraints. The permutation of object lifetimes over the coarse of a program's lifetime becomes arbitrary. Moreover, when deploying to limited hardware such as Raspberry Pi systems, these can come in handy when trying to deploy a program with the least amount of footprint as possible. Structs will be packed by default allowing no padding between fields, and no header either.
